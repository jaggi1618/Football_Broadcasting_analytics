# Project Title: [Your Project Name Here]

## 🚧 Project Status: Incomplete / Not Successfully Deployed

This project was an experimental attempt to build a [brief description, e.g., "broadcast-style football video analytics system using YOLO"]. While the core idea was innovative, the project faced several roadblocks that prevented successful completion.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project was to:
- [Objective 1 — e.g., Detect and track players and ball in a football match video]
- [Objective 2 — e.g., Generate visual stats like possession, highlights, and scorecards]
- [Objective 3 — e.g., Deliver match insights in a broadcast-ready format]

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 / YOLOv8
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## ✅ Work Completed

- ✅ Set up object detection with YOLO for initial player/ball recognition
- ✅ Preprocessed football video footage for analysis
- ✅ Started working on frame extraction and player tracking

---

## ❌ Issues Faced

- ⚠️ **Inaccurate ball tracking** in cluttered frames due to overlapping players
- ⚠️ **Frame-by-frame processing too slow** for long videos (inefficient pipeline)
- ⚠️ Difficulty in maintaining object identity over time (player tracking instability)
- ⚠️ GPU limitations in Colab restricted real-time or high-res processing
- ⚠️ Model not able to differentiate teams properly without labeled dataset

---

## 📘 Lessons Learned

- Importance of optimizing video processing pipelines
- Need for better training data or fine-tuned YOLO weights
- Advanced tracking (e.g., DeepSORT, ByteTrack) should be integrated early
- Consider lightweight deployment models or frame sampling strategies

---

## 🔁 Future Improvements

- Integrate advanced object tracking algorithms (e.g., DeepSORT or BoT-SORT)
- Use a lower frame-rate sampling strategy to reduce computation
- Train custom YOLO model on labeled football datasets for better accuracy
- Try segmenting video and running detection in parallel
- Explore hybrid models for analytics (e.g., combine YOLO + keypoint detection)
